# gorpc
Framework for building Go RPC server with versioned handlers and autogenerated documentation without code generation. You just write code and don't think about transport and documentation.

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/sergei-svistunov/gorpc?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/sergei-svistunov/gorpc/)

## Idea
<img src="https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/4607/35275402.0/0_b30c3_d6b1572b_orig">

You write handlers in native Go (with some restrictions), register them in HandlersManager, add transport implementation and documentation's UI to your application and it's all, now you have API with documentation. Documentation will update automatically if you add or change handlers.
